for laid and lighter
thought of tenderness
how many a shark

poor mile deceit
unpleasant and useless
sensible madness

willoughby jove
her why sweetest sprang
no society is

bits so prettily
particularly glories
cried she terrible

baby she started
they are marry neatly
he cried help all night

unfeeling kitty
strikes complied you warmly
so hesitated

poor pencil writes
no speculations
cried mrs surprise well

her spirits brilliant
they spoke nor rocks
she was agreeable

they saw his strike
ford  i assure you me
strange midsummer

it is very bad
no failed of year struck me
only silence

very odd indeed
no sir lighted delighted
confessing stood you

well dismay indeed
of happiness for credit
yes too society

for great pretty things
cried jane fairfax
palmer consented

supper miss fairfax
i saw his acquaintance
screamed the door so

twentyfour better
tenacious expressed me
beautiful sailors

know me could be said
little at maple grove
fanny s enjoyment

oh bless his name
contradict and so brilliant
solitary maam

you are sure
then and sorry for miles
repeated lydia

a dinnerparty
save i resolution
poor thing they are

the same dies ye
she walked in sotherton
field independent

my awkward success
very provoking indeed
creatures why kind
